# JAVA_MANS
A compilation of all the base programming concepts through the Java programming language

## HOW TO

The files of this manual are in Markdown (.md). You can read them anywhere but I seriously advise you to have a text editor to read them as it will render them like they should be.

You can also read them online through this reposatory (just click on the files) but if you want the full experience, download the ZIP or create a branch of this reposatory through git. You can then open the ZIP or the branch in Visual Studio Code and press **Ctrl + Shift + V**. In the source code, you are always welcome to change the colours through the variables at the top of the page. 

My defaults are :

    --text: #F7E0CD;
    --title: #708C69;
    --highlight: #D69992;
    --link: #B15A43;
