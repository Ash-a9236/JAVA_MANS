# JAVA_MANS

This is a manual on how to program in Java, from the base concepts like datatypes and objects to more advanced like design patterns, streams, ect. 
This is not an official manual, it comes from my understanding, experience, and research as a programmer and student myself.

## HOW TO

The files of this manual are in Markdown (.md). You can read them anywhere but I seriously advise you to have a text editor to read them as it will render them like they should be.

You can also read them online through this reposatory (just click on the files) but if you want the full experience, download the ZIP or create a branch of this reposatory through git. You can then open the ZIP or the branch in Visual Studio Code and press **Ctrl + Shift + V**. In the source code, you are always welcome to change the colours through the variables at the top of the page. 

My defaults are :

    --text: #F7E0CD;
    --title: #708C69;
    --highlight: #D69992;
    --link: #B15A43;

To create a new branch of this reposatory on your computer :
For git (bash) : run those commands line by line

```console
cd Documents
git clone https://github.com/Ash-a9236/JAVA_MANS.git
cd JAVA_MANS
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

I reccommend 'pulling' once in a while, in case I update the reposatory
```console
git pull origin main
```


## I NEED HELP

If you ever need help with a part, the first step is to go search on the web for an answer.
I reccomend :
* <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions">Stack Overflow</a>
* <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">Geeks for Geeks</a>
* <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 School</a>
* <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeCademy</a>

If none of these work and you are really stuck, you can always create an issue on this reposatory with the question and I will try to answer it directly.
