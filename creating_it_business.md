## key taxes

-> business number (BN) : used to interact with CRA for taxes (equivalent of NAS for company)
-> GST/HST is paid only if you make more than 30K revenue (it allows you to recover input tax credit (ITCs) on business purchases)
-> corporate income tax (T2) : pay taxes on the corporation profits separately (between 5 - 9 % (???))

payroll -> if you have a company employees = you need to pay the CPP (canada pension plan) or QPP (qc pension plan) and the EO (unemployement insurance)


input tax credit (ITCs) = allows businesses to recover the GST/HST on their business purchases


## taxes and deductions

the company needs to have at least one canadiant citsent or permanent resident to open a CCPC (canadian controlled private corpo)

why -> even less taxes than the small business reduction

-> CCPC pay 9% taxe on their first 500K income (per fiscal year) instead of the 15%
